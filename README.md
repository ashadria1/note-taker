# Note Taker

I have created an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an Express backend, and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## User Story

AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes

I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## What is it?

This app could prove useful to users who need to keep track of a lot of information.  In a fast-paced, competitive work environment, it can be easy to forget something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed. This application should allow users to create and save notes, view previously saved notes, and delete previously saved notes.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repo to your local machine, and open a new terminal in VSCode (e.g., Git Bash).
2. Make sure you're in the cloned directory, and initialize npm:  `npm init -y`.
3. Make sure npm is installed:  `npm install`.
4. Install the Express npm package: `npm install express`.
5. Install the fs npm package: `npm install fs`.
(You can also chain-install npm packages like this:  `npm install express fs`.)
4. Start the app: `npm start`.
5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your favorite browser.
6. Start saving notes!
